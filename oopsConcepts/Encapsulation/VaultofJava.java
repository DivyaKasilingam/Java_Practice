    /*
* Encapsulation is the concept of buidling the data (var) and the methods into a single unit or class.
-->restricting direct access THROUGH using access modifiers

Key Points:
•	Data is hidden using private access modifier.
•	You provide controlled access to the data through getter and setter methods (accessor methods).

4 Access Modifiers – The Gatekeepers
•	public:     Accessible from anywhere.
•	private:    Accessible only within the class.
•	protected:  Accessible within the same package or subclasses.
•	default (no modifier): Accessible only within the same package.

. Encapsulation in Real-life Example
Imagine a bank account class:
•	Private balance.
•	Public methods to deposit, withdraw, and check balance.
•	We control the flow of money, ensuring that 
users can’t set their balance directly to a negative value or withdraw more than they have.
________________________________________

Benefits of Encapsulation
•	Control: You can control how the data is accessed and modified. 
For instance, you can add validation checks in the 
setter method to ensure the data is valid before assigning it.

•	Flexibility: It allows the internal implementation to change 
without affecting other parts of the program that use the class.

•	Security: By making fields private, 
you can protect the object’s state and prevent unauthorized access or modification.
