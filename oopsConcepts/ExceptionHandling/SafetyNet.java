//Exception Handling – Java’s Safety Net

public class SafetyNet {
    /*Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors 
so that the program can continue executing instead of crashing. 

Key Points:
•	Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program.
•	Java handles exceptions using try, catch, finally, and throw.

1.Try and Catch – The Error Catchers
The try block contains the code that might cause an exception. 
If an exception occurs, it is caught in the catch block-->can handle the error.

2.Finally – The Cleanup Crew
The finally block will always execute, no matter what — even if there was no exception or if one was caught.

3.Throwing Exceptions – You Get an Exception!
manually throw an exception when something goes wrong.

4.Custom Exceptions – Build Your Own Errors
You can create your own exceptions by extending the Exception class. 
This lets you create very specific exceptions that are unique to your program.

5.Multiple Catch Blocks – Handling Different Errors
You can catch multiple exceptions in a 
single try-catch block using multiple catch clauses.
